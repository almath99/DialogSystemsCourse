We have 2 domains. One for entertainment and one for healthcare.

Entertainment Chatbot:

The bot works with choices. It gives you choices in boxes and you can pick the one you like. For example: - Pick the domain you would like me to help you with: Movie Theatrical play Mucic Games - Movie. - Would you like to watch a movie at home or at a movie theater? - At home. - Pick a genre you like. Thriller Horror Comedy Drama Action....

Then it recomends you some movies from the dataset that are in the chosen genre. If you do not like or you have already watched the movie, it recomends a different one from the chosen genre. (If you answer again negatively, it asks you to choose a different genre). The same works if you choose music.
